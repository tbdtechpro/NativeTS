"""Record what the REFERENCE DLL renders for whole songs.

The end-to-end counterpart to `dump_note_renders_oracle.py`, and the replacement for
`dump_song_renders.py` / the `stream_renders.json` references, both of which recorded the archived
C# port. Everything this engine builds has to compose correctly for a song to agree: MIDI parsing,
patch resolution, all four envelopes, both LFOs, the pitch ramp, the filter, the drum path with its
kits and choke groups, the three send effects, and the final quantisation.

**Tolerance, not digests, and for a sharper reason than the single notes.** A song runs the chorus
and reverb, whose LFOs the reference starts at a phase this port cannot yet derive, so two renders
that agree on every note still diverge sample by sample -- whole-song correlation against the oracle
sits near 0.18 even when the level and every octave band agree to a tenth of a dB. Sample identity
is therefore not merely unreachable, it is the wrong question. What is recorded is what
`docs/COMPARING_RENDERS.md` argues actually distinguishes a good render from a bad one: duration,
peak, RMS, per-octave level, and a coarse RMS envelope that catches a note going missing or arriving
late without being sensitive to phase.

The oracle audio is kept alongside so a failure can be measured with `compare_envelope.py` rather
than only counted. Roland-derived: generated locally, gitignored.

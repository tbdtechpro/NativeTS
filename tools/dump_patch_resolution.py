"""Resolve every (map, bank, program) slot and dump what it sounds.

A *differential* oracle for the patch directory, written directly against the reverse-engineering
notes rather than translated from the C++ so that agreement between the two is evidence.

The chain under test is three levels deep and carries three distinct tone spaces, which is the part
most likely to be got wrong:

    LUT1[map] -> l1                     (0xff means the map is undefined)
    LUT2[l1 * 0x80 + bank] -> l2        (0xff means the bank is undefined)
    LUT3[l2 * 0x80 + program] -> word   (0xffff means unassigned)

The word must be read UNSIGNED. Bit 15 marks a tone reachable only through an alternate-articulation
entry, not a missing one; reading it signed and bailing on the sign makes real patches disappear.
Words at or above 0x6000 index the alternate-articulation table, whose *primary* reference is what
an ordinary poly note sounds -- the secondary is a conditional articulation only mono/solo reaches.

A bank select picks a variation, and when the selected variation has no entry for a program a Sound
Canvas sounds the capital tone at bank 0 rather than falling silent. That fallback is reproduced.

Usage:
    python3 tools/dump_patch_resolution.py <SCCore.dll> <output.json> [--manifest assets/manifest.json]

Roland-derived output: generate locally, do not redistribute.

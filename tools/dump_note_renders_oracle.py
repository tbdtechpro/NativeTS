"""Record what the REFERENCE DLL renders for a spread of single notes.

This replaces `dump_note_renders.py`, which recorded what the archived C# port rendered. That was a
sound oracle while the C# engine was the reference; it is not one now. It predates several fixes
this engine has since made -- the unaligned-loop decode and the pitch ramp among them -- so its
digests encode behaviour both engines have moved past, and a case where the two disagree says
nothing about which is right.

**These fixtures are tolerance gates, not digest gates, and that is not a compromise.** This port is
not bit-exact with the DLL and does not aim to be: the two differ by float rounding, by an
uninitialised ring the reference reads on a recycled voice, and by effect LFO phase. A sha256 over
the oracle's samples could only ever fail. What is recorded instead is what a difference has to
respect -- length, peak, RMS, and per-octave level -- which is exactly the standard
`docs/COMPARING_RENDERS.md` argues for and tight enough that a real regression cannot hide under it.

The audio itself is written alongside as raw interleaved float32, so a failure can be listened to
and measured rather than only counted. It is Roland-derived, so like the tables it is generated
locally and gitignored.

**Each case is rendered in its own process, and that is not a performance oversight.** The harness
has a batch mode that renders the whole sweep at once with a GS reset between cases, and it was used
here until the reset turned out not to isolate them: the reference's LFO nodes live in a pool whose
random registers survive being freed, so a tone with a random LFO opens on whatever the previous
case left behind. Measured, three cases in the sweep sat up to 5.8 cents from their own isolated
render -- and two of them were being read as failures of this engine when the engine was right. The
cases are independent, so the processes run concurrently and the cost is mostly recovered.
